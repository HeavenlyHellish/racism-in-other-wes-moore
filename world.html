      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Racism Across the Globe</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Racism is not just an American problem. Around the world, people face discrimination based on skin color, 
        ethnicity, religion, or language. From colonial history to modern laws, racism has shaped where people live, 
        what jobs they can get, and how governments treat them. Looking at examples worldwide helps us see that 
        racism is a global issue, not just local.

      </figure>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        From 1948 to 1994, South Africa enforced <strong>Apartheid</strong>, a system of racial segregation. Black South Africans 
        were denied the right to vote, forced to live in certain areas, and given fewer resources in schools and jobs. 
        Even though Apartheid ended, inequality remains: many Black South Africans still live in poor communities, 
        while wealth is concentrated among white families.

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        In many European countries, immigrants and refugees from Africa and the Middle East face discrimination. 
        They are more likely to be unemployed, live in crowded housing, and experience harassment. Reports by 
        the European Union show that about <strong>45% of Black people in Europe</strong> say they have experienced racism in the past 5 years.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>According to the United Nations, <strong>1 in 3 people worldwide</strong> say they have experienced discrimination based on race or ethnicity.</li>
        <li>Countries with colonial histories, like Brazil and India, still face deep racial inequalities in education, jobs, and politics.</li>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Why This Matters</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
        By seeing racism in different countries, we understand that this is not just an American story. 
        The fight for equality is global, and learning from each place’s struggles and victories helps us imagine fairer societies everywhere.
