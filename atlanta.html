        In 1938, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation created maps of Atlanta that graded neighborhoods from “A” (best) to “D” (worst). 
        Mostly Black neighborhoods were marked with red ink, a practice called <strong>redlining</strong>. This meant banks refused to give 
        loans or charged very high interest rates. As a result, Black families had fewer chances to buy homes, build wealth, or move to safer areas. 
        These unfair practices shaped where people could live for decades.      </p>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Even though redlining is no longer legal, its effects are still visible. Many of the neighborhoods that were graded “D” 
        are still majority Black and continue to struggle with lower home values, fewer businesses, and underfunded schools. 
        On the other hand, neighborhoods that were given “A” ratings remain wealthier and mostly white. 
        This shows how past policies continue to shape Atlanta today, creating a cycle of inequality that is hard to break.      </p>
